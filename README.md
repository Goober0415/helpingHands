# helpingHands
In 2018 my mom and I moved from Colorado to New Mexico after her and my father divorced. It was a great new start for both of us, but she fell ill in 2019, she suffered a major heart attack, leaving her with a brain injury which makes it hard for her to remember things, especially short term. My mom has always been strong, she took care of me and my brother, and she also took care of my grandmother, I learned from my mom at a young age that we care for our elders as they did for us. So she now lives with my wife and I and my mother in law Lisa and our three dogs.
The struggle to help my mom remember simple tasks is hard, sometimes, she remembers some things more then other times, and sometimes I forget to remind her of things and I'm left worrying about her.
My solution? Create a helping hands buddy for her that is both helpful, interactive and fun for her to use.
